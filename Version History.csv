+ The first row of products on each CI page had an incorrect formula calculating the total licenses for the product which led to the total number of licenses being counted for the row below reported in the TOTAL cell.
+ The top row calculation in columns I-N in row 9 (the first product) of all pages should reference ""('Image Master List'!$J3:$BO3)"".  It incorrectly referenced ""('Image Master List'!$J4:$BO4)"".
+ Most likely cause was during the addition of ActivClient CAC version 6.2.0.82 to the Image Master List page.  Since this was the top row in the table, the CI pages automatically updated all the formulas in I9:N9 and all rows in the CI pages to look down one row lower on the Image Master List page, thus the incorrect reference of $J4:$BO4 on the top most product row of all CI pages.
+ Recommended work around is to never add a product to the top of the list.  Leave row 3 on Image Master List as is and add rows below.  Excel will update other CI pages correctly when this method is applied.
+ Fix was to replace ""$J4:$BO4"" on a CI sheet with ""$J3:$BO3"" and then drag-fill cells I9 through N9 to the bottom of the table.  Apply this fix to all CI pages.  Reminder: CI pages must be unprotected before editing."
